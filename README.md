# iOS-Portfolio-Thunstrom22

Hi! My name is Ariel Thunstrom and this is a portfolio of the projects I have worked on throughout high school. The first computer science class I took was AP Computer Science Principles. In that class, I made basic apps, such as a coloring app, with MIT app inventor. I have also taken CyberSecurity and AP Computer Sciene A: Java. In Cyber Security, I learned about the fundementals of staying secure online and I also gained experience with Python. In AP Computer Science A: Java, I learned the basics of Java and applied my knowledge to complete problems like Advent of Code. 
## EPHS Timer App
* helped with UI design 
* learned basic functionality of swift ui
## Minnesota Schools Lost and Found
* The lost and found at my high school is filled to the brim with items, students can spend hours looking through piles of coats and still come out with nothing. The purpose of the lost and found app is to create a place where staff memembers can take pictures of items in the lost and found and students can then easily see what is in the lost and found without digging through piles of items. 
* For the past few weeks, my group and I have been working on basic funtionality of the app and designing the user interface. I have mainly been working on the user interface, I beleive that in order to have a successful app the UI must be efficient and easy to navigate. I used balsamiq to create the wireframes.
