# iOS-Portfolio-Thunstrom22

Hi! My name is Ariel Thunstrom and this is a portfolio of the projects I have worked on throughout high school. The first computer science class I took was AP Computer Science Principles. In that class, I made basic apps, such as a coloring app, with MIT app inventor. I have also taken CyberSecurity and AP Computer Sciene A: Java. In Cyber Security, I learned about the fundementals of staying secure online and I also gained experience with Python. In AP Computer Science A: Java, I learned the basics of Java and applied my knowledge to complete problems like Advent of Code.
