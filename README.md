# iOS-Portfolio-Thunstrom22
Hi! My name is Ariel Thunstrom and this is a portfolio of the projects I have worked on throughout high school. The first computer science class I took was AP Computer Science Principles. In that class, I made basic apps, such as a coloring app, with MIT app inventor. I have also taken CyberSecurity and AP Computer Science A: Java. In Cyber Security, I learned about the fundamentals of staying secure online and I also gained experience with Python. In AP Computer Science A: Java, I learned the basics of Java and applied my knowledge to complete problems like Advent of Code. Currently, I am taking iOS App Development.


# [APCS A Projects](https://github.com/ArielThunstrom/AP-CS-A-2021)
* In AP Computer Science A, I worked on many different projects and each one of them helped me to gain a deeper understanding of java. 

### [Advent of Code](https://github.com/ArielThunstrom/Advent-of-Code) 
* Advent of Code is a series of programming problems that are released daily during the month of December. I completed these problems using java. While completing each challenge, I learned how to import data and work with arrays, ArrayLists, and 2D arrays. 
 


# [EPHS Class Timer](https://github.com/BillA-Dev/EPHS)
* The EPHS Timer App was one of the first projects that I contributed to in iOS App Development. I found it extremely beneficial to look at functioning code because it helped me to understand the structure and process of writing code in SwiftUI. I helped with some elements of the UI design and I also created the icon for the administration companion app using Sketch.

# [Missing Stuff](https://github.com/EPHS-iOS/Minnesota-School-Lost-Found)
* The lost and found at my high school is filled to the brim with items; students can spend hours looking through piles of coats and still come out with nothing. The purpose of the Missing Stuff App app is to create a place where staff members can take pictures of items in the lost and found and students can then easily see what is in the lost and found without digging through piles of items. 
* This was the main project that I worked on in iOS App Development. I mainly worked on the UI design for this app. From this project, I learned how to create a UI that is functional and pleasing to the eye. I also created the images for the App Store using HotPot.

# [Post It App](https://github.com/EPHS-iOS/Spring2022GroupProject) 
* Each year, students in AP CSP create Post-It note instalations around EPHS. In iOS App Development, we created a game that encourages students to look for the art around the school and take pictures of it in order to earn points. I was the project manager for this project, meaning I assigned tasks and ensured they got done within a reasonable time. I also helped with the UI designs.

# [Study With Buddy](https://github.com/ArielThunstrom/loph2/tree/main)
* Recently, studies have shown that teens get distracted by phones every 15 minutes, and once they are distracted it takes an average of 23 minutes for them to get back on track. This causes the students to lack focus, and makes it difficult to for them to succeed in classes. As upperclassmen in high school, we are constantly studying for tests and working on projects. Our homework requires our full attention, but it can be hard to focus when your phone is just sitting there, waiting for you to open TikTik or Instagram. But what if you phone could actually help you focus? Our app study buddy solves this problem.

# CyberStart National Scholarship Finalist
* In CyberSecurity, I participated in CyberStart America. CyberStart America is a cyber security training game for high schoolers. I earned over 20,000 points on CyberStart America. I earned the bronze award for gettting over 3,000 points. I was also in the top 2,000 scores, earning a spot as a finalist for the CyberStart National Scholarship.

# AP CSP Create Project
* AP CSP was the first computer science classes I took as a sophmore in high school. I worked on many small projects, such as a quiz and coloring app. Part of the AP exam for this class is the create project. The create project has simple requirements, allowing lots of creative freedom. For my create project, I created a game called coffee cafe. The goal of the game is to gather all the items in the order and return to the star, without runnung into the coffe spills. I used MIT app inventor to create this project. 
* I earned a 5 on the AP exam.
